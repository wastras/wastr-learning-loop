> **Why this problem, why us, why now.**

## The Problem

Construction & demolition waste (CDW) logistics in Norway is fragmented, manual
and undocumented:

- ~70% of SMB transporters coordinate jobs by phone, paper, and spreadsheet.
- Empty-running (tomkjøring) routinely exceeds 30% of truck-km — trucks return
  empty after deliveries instead of carrying waste back.
- Construction sites lose hundreds of admin hours per project to waste
  coordination and weigh-slip chasing.
- Builders cannot produce structured NS 9431 / ESG reports without after-the-fact
  reconstruction.

## Why It Matters Now

- **Regulation:** EU 70% CDW recycling target by 2030; Norwegian implementation
  is tightening NS 9431 documentation requirements.
- **Market:** ~70% of Norwegian CDW operators still phone + spreadsheet; the
  ground is uncontested by purpose-built software.
- **Technology:** AI cost curve makes route optimization and image-based waste
  classification economically viable at SMB scale (margins of NOK 200–500k/yr
  per truck, not Fortune-500 budgets).

## The Insight

The bottleneck is not weighing, billing or compliance — it is **coordination at
the source**. If we capture {photo + geolocation + waste fraction} at the moment
of the job request (zero-app, QR-initiated), the rest of the chain — matching,
routing, documentation, ESG reporting — becomes a database problem rather than
a phone-tree problem.

This inverts the usual "digitize the back office first" approach.

## The Solution (one paragraph)

Wastr is a neutral, vendor-agnostic data infrastructure for CDW logistics:
builders place pickup orders via a QR-initiated web flow (no app install); a
matching service routes orders to nearby SMB transporters; drivers execute
pickups via a mobile-friendly app with evidence capture; the platform produces
NS 9431-compliant documentation automatically. Two-way logistics (outgoing
materials + return waste) is the technical core IP.

## What Is Actually Shipped Today (MVP)

- QR-initiated customer ordering with geolocation capture.
- Multi-tenant Collector app with company / personal order views, drag-and-drop
  route builder, real-time updates via SignalR.
- Driver app with pickup / delivery flows and evidence capture (photo + weight
  slip + signature + GPS).
- Order lifecycle (Pending → Accepted → InProgress → Completed) with immutable
  audit trail.
- Service-to-service Azure AD identity, JIT user provisioning, company isolation.
- Event-driven notifications (email/SMS) via Azure Service Bus + Functions.

## On the Roadmap (Not Yet Shipped)

- Two-way routing engine PoC (research project #5).
- Computer-vision waste classification (research projects #6–8).
- Full ESG / NS 9431 reporting dashboard.
- Neutral multi-actor API standard (research project #9).

## Why Us

- **Denis Pozhinsky (CEO)** — construction & project management background,
  direct line to Oslo builders and transporters.
- **Siarhei Karabitski (CTO)** — 15+ years building production .NET systems
  at Telenor, Rystad Energy, Statens vegvesen.
- **Philip Hansteen (advisor)** — ex-Equinor Techstars; ESG and partnerships.
- **Research network** — NTNU, SINTEF Digital & AI, TØI, BI, Simula, OsloMet
  AI Lab, Lindum.

## What We Believe That Others Don't

1. **The wedge is the order, not the weight.** Sensor-led and weigh-slip-led
   approaches arrive too late in the chain to fix coordination.
2. **Neutrality is a moat.** A vendor-agnostic platform can connect independent
   transporters across company silos in a way no transporter-owned tool can.
3. **Two-way optimization is the real ML problem.** Single-leg VRP is solved;
   bidirectional reverse-logistics with dynamic demand is open territory.
4. **QR + no-app onboarding beats sensor + hardware.** Zero-friction wins at
   SMB scale.
